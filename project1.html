        <h1 class="title">Personal Portfolio Project</h1>
        <p class="section__text__p2"><br>Overview and Goals : </p>
            <div class="text-container">
                    <p>As a computer science student, I wanted to create a central hub to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The primary goal of this portfolio was to build a professional and accessible website that effectively communicates my passion for software development and my readiness for an internship. I aimed to create a clean, user-friendly, and responsive site that would leave a positive impression on potential employers and collaborators.</p>
            </div>

        <p class="section__text__p2"><br>Inspiration: </p>
            <div class="text-container">
                    <p>My inspiration came from a desire for a minimalist and modern aesthetic. I focused on a design that prioritizes readability and ease of navigation. The layout is a single-page design with anchor links to allow for smooth scrolling between sections. The color scheme is simple and professional, using a neutral palette to ensure that the content is the main focus. I chose the "Poppins" font for its clean and modern look, which enhances the overall readability of the site.</p>
            </div>
        
        <p class="section__text__p2"><br>Challenges : </p>
            <div class="text-container">
                    <p>One of the main challenges was ensuring the website was fully responsive across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktops. This required careful planning and the extensive use of media queries to adjust the layout and styling for different screen sizes. Implementing the hamburger menu for mobile navigation also presented a learning opportunity, as I had to use JavaScript to toggle the menu's visibility and create a seamless user experience.</p>
            </div>

        <p class="section__text__p2"><br>Key Features : </p>
            <div class="text-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> The website is fully responsive and accessible on various devices, thanks to the use of CSS media queries.</li>
                        <li><b>Interactive Navigation:</b> The site features a hamburger menu for mobile navigation, which was implemented using JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy Contact:</b> The portfolio includes direct links to my resume, email, and LinkedIn profile, making it easy for visitors to get in touch.</li>
                        <li><b>SEO Optimized:</b> Basic SEO principles were applied to improve the site's visibility on search engines.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
        
        <p class="section__text__p2"><br>Learning Outcomes : </p>
            <div class="text-container">
                    <p>This project was a great opportunity to solidify my front-end development skills. I gained hands-on experience with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and learned how to structure a website for both aesthetics and functionality. I also developed a deeper understanding of responsive design principles and the importance of creating an accessible and user-friendly web experience. This project has given me a solid foundation in web development that I am excited to build upon in future roles.</p>
